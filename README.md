### Port Forwarding Required

- **Why is Port Forwarding Required?**  
   To allow other players to connect to your server over the internet, you **must configure port forwarding**. Your router does not know which device on your local network should receive incoming traffic from the internet. Port forwarding tells your router to "send all requests coming to port `25565` directly to the computer running the server."

Without port forwarding, only devices on your own local network will be able to connect to the server. No one from the internet will be able to join.
